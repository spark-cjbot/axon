    Resolution strategy (tried in order):

       anywhere in the codebase.  If multiple matches exist, the one with
       the shortest file path is chosen (heuristic for proximity).

    For method calls (``call.receiver`` is non-empty):
    - If the receiver is ``"self"`` or ``"this"``, look for a method with
      that name in the same class (same file, matching class_name).
